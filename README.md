# Bag-of-words

## Description
This is a mini-project I made when I first started leaning NLP (Natural Language Processing), and it's a statistical language model based on word count that represents a text as the bag of the words composing it. It's a very simple representation and it was a first introductory step that helped me get more familiar with NLP.
